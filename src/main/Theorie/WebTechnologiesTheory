Theory

Factory.InterGenericDAO (Data Access Object):
- is a design pattern
- provides an abstract interface to a database or other persistence mechanisms

1. Abstraction: Factory.InterGenericDAO pattern abstracts and encapsulates all access to the data source. Factory.InterGenericDAO manages connection with the data source
                to obtain and store data
2. Separation of Concerns: business logic of an application is separated from the data access logic
                           -> Code gets more modular and easier to maintain
3. CRUD Operations: DAOs provide methods for Create, Read, Update and Delete operations
                    -> methods interact with the database without exposing the underlying details of the DB
4. Implementation: ->Factory.InterGenericDAO-Pattern.png

JSON:
- is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate
- objects are written into {}
- arrays are written into []
- JSON supports several data types, including strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, and null

-> is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a web application, as well as for config files and data storages
-> is derived from javascript
-> language independent -> many languages support JSON for data interchange

Web protocols:
- ensure that data is transmitted accurately and efficiently over the internet
- they enable different devices and systems to communicate with each other effectively

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):
- suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet
-> TCP ensures reliable data transmission
-> IP handles addressing and routing

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- connectionless
- does not establish a dedicated end-to-end connection
- packages are send independently without ensuring they reach their destination

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
- foundation of data communication on the web
- used for transferring web pages from servers to browsers

HTTPS (HTTP Secure): Port 443
- includes encryption for secure communication over a computer network

FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Port 20/21
- used for transferring files between client and server on a network

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Port 25
- used for sending emails across networks

IMAP and POP3 (Internet Message Access Protocol and Post Office Protocol)
-> retrieve emails from a (email-)server
-> IMAP Port 143
-> POP3 Port 110

Telnet: Port 23
-  allows users to remotely access and manage devices over a TCP/IP Network
-  has been replaced by ssh

SSH (Secure Shell): 22
- allows users to securely access and manage remote devices over an unsecured network
- it then provides a secure channel for executing commands, transferring files (SFTP) and managing network services

DNS (Domain Name System) Port 52
- Translates domain names into IP addresses so that users can reach target servers by entering names instead of IPs.

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Port 67
- assigns new devices on the network an IP-Address

Websocket
- enables a bidirectional communication between browsers and servers
- is used for realtime applications like chat apps and online games

Web Interfaces
- enable users to access and manipulate content and services on the internet
- bridge between user and web app
- based on web protocols
API (Application Programming Interface)
- Interface between between two systems (e.g. Front- and Backend)
